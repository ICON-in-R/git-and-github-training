## Introduction to Git

Git is a **version control system**, like a powerful "save button" for your files and directories. It helps you track changes and keep a history of your project.

## Git vs. a Text Editor üìù

A text editor saves the entire file at once, giving you only one record unless you make manual copies (e.g., `draft1.doc`, `draft2.doc`).

Git, on the other hand, records the *differences* in files and folders and keeps a historical record of every save. This is a game-changer for developers!

## Why is Git Useful? ü§î

### For Individuals:

-   Review how your project grows over time.
-   Easily look at or restore file states from the past.

### For Teams:

-   Share and collaborate on projects with other developers.
-   Push your project to platforms like **GitHub**, Bitbucket, or GitLab.

## Git + GitHub = ‚ù§Ô∏è

-   **Git** works on your **local** machine.
-   **GitHub** is a **remote** storage facility on the web for your coding projects.
-   You can have private repos and manage access
